Screw Tests Procedures and Instructions

Things to keep in mind while setting up:
- Plug sensor into computer at least 30 min. before testing to let it warm up
- Have the sensor display open and reading during set up so you can make sure you don't overload sensor accidentally
- Keep a written log of the tests you are performing. Organize by set # and test # 
  (set describes current media, test describes current input params)
- make sure to write down the conditions for each set and test (media used, input params)

Status codes to watch out for:
0xC0000000 -- Warning! Out of calibration range. You are close to overloading the sensor.
0x88000000 -- Super Warning! Out of gage range. You are close to damaging the sensor.
If you see these on the event log you are straining the sensor too much, try to ease the load being put on it.


- Single Screw Tests
Constant Speed Test:
1) Configuration should be in free hang. HIT UNBIAS SENSOR BUTTON!
2) Ensure that media is smoothed and uniform as possible
3) Write down current set(material)/test(current trial that you're doing) info in notebook. 
4) Ensure proper set/test number is set on motor script AND sensor log
  Tools -> Sensor log  -> (three dots) -> Name it -> Click on New File
5) Start motor script and sensor log (I try to start them at the same time but it doesn't have to be exact)
6) synchronization procedure will start, after 3 screw spins to set position.
7) After synchronization procedure, you have 20 seconds to set the screw down. Firmly push it into media to sink it in.
8) AFTER SETTING DOWN, BIAS THE SENSOR
9) 20 seconds after sync procedure, actual trial will start. Be prepared to stop motor script just in case.
10) Ensure that the proper data files (with the correct set/test number) were saved.


Constant Torque Test:
Steps 1-6 exactly the same as constant speed test.
7) During this step, make sure someone pushes the configuration forward agianst the "brake" on  while setting down.
8) This time the screw may or may not spin during trial. Watch to make sure the test bed itself doesn't move.
Steps 9-10 same
